Masha Allah, whoever has written this must be blessed with full knowledge and patience. What a comparison. Subhanallah!!... I didn't write this but felt it is worth sharing! 
" Quite amazing <BR><BR/>


Things I have noticed while reflecting on the story of Yusuf (A.S) & to the story of Musa (A.S), while comparing Sura Yusuf and Sura Qasas. I thought it is beneficial to share.
<BR><BR/>

1. The story of Yusuf makes you wonder why the mom was never mentioned; the story of Musa makes you wonder why the dad was never mentioned.
<BR><BR/>

    2. Yusuf story begins with the interaction between father and son; Musa story begins with the interaction between mother and son

<BR/>


3. In Yusuf story, his siblings were the reason Yusuf got separated from his family; In Musa story, his sibling was the reason Musa got reunited with his family
<BR/><BR/>

4. In Yusuf story, the siblings convinced their dad INTELLECTUALLY to let go of Yusuf; In Musa story, Allah convinced the mom EMOTIONALLY to let go of Musa

<BR/>

5. In Yusuf story, the dad (who IS a prophet) was NEVER told if he will ever reunite with his son; in Musa story, the mom (who is NOT a prophet) was told that she WILL reunite with her son 
<BR/>12:18	<BR/><BR/>

6. In Yusuf story, the dad cries tears of sadness; in Musa story, the mom cries tears of happiness
<BR/><BR/>

7. Yusuf got dumped in a standing water (well); Musa got dumped in a flowing water (River)
<BR/>7	12:15	28:7<BR/><BR/>


8. Yusuf was brought to his new house by a male figure (Egypt’s minister); Musa was brought to his new house by a female figure (Pharaoh’s wife)
<BR/><BR/>

9. In Yusuf story, the minister told his wife to either take him as a slave or as an adopted son; In Musa story, pharaoh’s wife told her husband to either take him as a slave or as an adopted son
<BR/>	12:21	28:9<BR/><BR/>

10. In Yusuf story, I expected the minister’s wife to take Yusuf as a son, because they never had kids, but he was taken as a slave instead; In Musa story, I expected the pharaoh to take Musa as a slave, because he was an Israelite, but he was taken as an adopted son instead
<BR/><BR/>
11. Yusuf’s life changed from a life of dignity to a life of slavery; Musa’s life changed from a life of slavery to a life of dignity
<BR/><BR/>

12. In Sura Yusuf, Allah mentions that he gave Yusuf wisdom and knowledge; in Sura Qasas, Allah mentions that he gave Musa wisdom and knowledge
<BR/>12:22	28:14<BR/><BR/>

13. Yusuf was also given an exceptional trait (Looks); Musa was also given an exceptional trait (Strength)
<BR/><BR/>

14. Yusuf got into trouble with the Minister’s wife because of his exceptional trait (looks); Musa got into trouble with the authority because of his exceptional trait (strength)
<BR/>12:23	28:15<BR/><BR/>

15. The crime that was about to happen to Yusuf was private in nature; the crime that happened to Musa was public in nature
<BR/><BR/>
16. The crime that was about to happen to Yusuf was the killing of a soul (Zina); The crime that happened to Musa was the killing of a body (murder)
<BR/><BR/>
17. Yusuf sought refuge of Allah before the crime happened; Musa sought refuge of Allah after the crime happened
<BR/>12:33	28:16<BR/><BR/>

18. Yusuf, who was innocent, ended up getting detained by the law; Musa, who was guilty, ended up fleeing the law
